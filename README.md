# Machine Learning Zoomcamp

This repository contains the homeworks and code for the Machine Learning Zoomcamp course offered by DataTalks.Club. The course is designed to teach us the practical aspects of machine learning engineering in 4 months. I will learn how to implement, evaluate, and deploy various machine learning algorithms using Python, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Flask, Docker, Kubernetes, and more.

## Course Overview

The course consists of two parts:

### Part 1: Machine learning algorithms and their implementation

- Linear Regression
- Classification
- Decision Trees
- Ensemble Learning
- Neural Networks and Deep Learning

Technologies: Python, Jupyter Notebooks, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Keras

### Part 2: Deployment

- Flask
- Pipenv
- Docker
- AWS Lambda
- TensorFlow Lite
- Kubernetes
- TensorFlow Serving
- KServe

Technologies: Flask, Pipenv, Docker, AWS Lambda, TensorFlow Lite, Kubernetes, TensorFlow Serving, KServe

## Course Projects

In addition to the homework assignments, there are two projects that I need to complete in order to get a certificate of completion:

- Midterm project: I will create a car-price prediction project using linear regression and feature engineering techniques.
- Capstone project: I will create a churn prediction project using logistic regression and evaluation metrics. I will also deploy my models using Flask and Docker.

I will continue to upload related assignments and projects here as I finish them.
